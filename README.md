Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy Optimization
promotions.

**Business Problem**
Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry. It can result in revenue loss, increased customer acquisition costs, and reduced brand loyalty.  
In a highly competitive market, SyriaTel must proactively identify and respond to customer dissatisfaction before they switch to competitors.

**Objectives**
- Identifying customers most likely to churn before they leave.
- Understanding the drivers of churn, such as service quality, pricing, or competitor offers.
- Implementing personalized strategies to retain high-risk customers.
- Reducing acquisition costs by improving retention.


Dataset Selection:
The **SyriaTel Customer Churn** dataset was chosen for this project. It provides a 9-month record of customer behavior, including call activity, service usage, and social network analysis (SNA) features. These rich variables support high-accuracy churn prediction and enable data-driven decision-making.

Overview
This Jupyter Notebook presents a comprehensive churn prediction framework using machine learning models, focusing on Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The goal is to identify high-risk customers before they leave, understand the key drivers of churn, and implement strategic retention interventions to reduce customer loss while optimizing business decision-making.

**Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
Before model training, extensive data preprocessing was performed:
- Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing data where necessary to ensure dataset completeness.
- Feature Scaling: Used standardization to normalize variables for better model accuracy.
- Categorical Encoding: Converted categorical features into numerical representations to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
- Feature Selection: Conducted analysis to remove irrelevant features while preserving high-impact attributes.

Outcome: A refined dataset optimized for predictive modeling, ensuring maximum model performance and efficiency.

**Model Training & Performance Evaluation**

We trained and evaluated three models for churn prediction:
1. Logistic Regression:
✔ Provides baseline insights, but struggled with recall (71%), leading to many missed churners.
✔ Accuracy: 78% | Precision: 40% | F1-score: 51%
2. Random Forest:
✔ Strong balance between recall & precision but missed some churn cases.
✔ Accuracy: 92% | Precision: 83% | F1-score: 74%
3. XGBoost (Best Model):
✔ Highest recall (81%), ensuring minimal false negatives (missed churners).
✔ Best F1-score (86%), demonstrating excellent model balance.
✔ Highest accuracy (96%), proving superior churn prediction capability.

Outcome: XGBoost was identified as the best-performing model for predicting churn, outperforming others significantly in recall, precision, and overall prediction stability.

**Fine-Tuning & Threshold Adjustment**

To improve model effectiveness, we optimized hyperparameters using Grid Search CV and adjusted classification thresholds to increase recall while maintaining precision:
✔ Fine-tuned XGBoost model with optimized parameters (learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=7, n_estimators=100, scale_pos_weight=3).
✔ Threshold adjusted to 0.443, allowing the model to capture more churners without excessive false positives.
✔ Visualized Precision-Recall trade-offs, helping determine the best classification balance for retention efforts.

Outcome: The optimized XGBoost model effectively flags high-risk churn customers, ensuring proactive intervention while minimizing false alarms.

**Business Implications**

The model identified key drivers of churn, providing valuable insights for business decision-making:
✔ Customer service quality—Customers with frequent service complaints were more likely to churn.
✔ Pricing dissatisfaction—Higher pricing led to increased customer attrition.
✔ Competitor influence—Users frequently making international calls were prone to switching due to better market alternatives.
✔ Usage behavior—Customers with low engagement in voicemail and premium features showed churn tendencies.

Outcome: These findings support strategic improvements in pricing models, customer service enhancements, and personalized retention strategies.

**Strategic Recommendations**
1. Deploy the XGBoost Model for Churn Prediction
- Use XGBoost with the optimized threshold (0.443) to flag churn-prone customers.
- Integrate the model with CRM systems for automated intervention strategies.
- Continuously retrain the model on fresh data to adapt to changing customer behaviors.

2. Enhance Customer Service
- Focus on high-risk customers with frequent service interactions to improve retention.
- Improve response times and issue resolution efficiency to strengthen loyalty.
- Offer VIP support tiers for premium customers to reduce churn risk.

3. Optimize International Plans & Pricing
- Review pricing for international call plans to enhance competitiveness.
- Offer special packages or discounts based on customer usage patterns.
- Address concerns of high-international usage customers with tailored promotions.

4.Promote Voice Mail Plan Adoption
- Customers using voicemail show lower churn rates—bundling voicemail can reduce attrition.
- Introduce targeted promotions or service enhancements to drive voicemail adoption.

Outcome: These recommendations directly address churn drivers and create actionable strategies for customer retention, revenue optimization, and long-term business growth.

Final Takeaways
- XGBoost is the best model for churn prediction and should be deployed for real-time customer risk monitoring.
- Adjusting thresholds ensures effective churn capture while maintaining precision.
- Data-driven insights reveal churn patterns, allowing targeted interventions.
- Strategic retention actions should focus on loyalty incentives, service quality, and pricing competitiveness.
- Automated retention systems should be integrated into CRM to ensure timely customer outreach.

Next Steps:
- Deploy the model into a real-time customer retention system.
- Monitor prediction effectiveness and refine strategies using fresh data.
- Enhance customer engagement programs based on model-driven insights.

This Notebook serves as a powerful tool for predictive churn prevention, ensuring data-driven decision-making for enhanced customer retention strategies.
